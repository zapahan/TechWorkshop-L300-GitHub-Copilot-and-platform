# Exercise 04: Secure development with GitHub Advanced Security

## Scenario

This training will have you implement a customer proof of concept using DevOps and AI-driven development practices. The customer in this scenario is Zava, a retail chain that specializes in "do-it-yourself" solutions for home improvement projects. Zava has a simple storefront prototype and would like to establish best practices for DevOps setup and AI-assisted development and delivery. In this lab, you will configure GitHub Enterprise with security best practices, set up Visual Studio Code, GitHub Copilot, and Azure MCP Server to streamline DevOps planning and delivery, and extend the solution using Azure AI Foundry to generate and enhance application code.

In this exercise, you will configure GitHub Advanced Security features and enable code quality gates, security code reviews and leverage features such as automatic Pull Requests to support developer productivity and awareness.

## Objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll be able to:

- Configure and leverage GitHub Advanced Security features
- Prevent secrets from being pushed to a repository
- Automatically detect and fix vulnerabilities
- Review Copilot alerts and recommendations

## Duration
