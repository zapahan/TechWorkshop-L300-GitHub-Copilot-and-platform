# Task 03 - Scan repositories for vulnerabilities and code quality

## Description

GitHub Advanced Security provides many tools that assist developers with keeping their code clean and secure, while also improving the efficiency of this process. In this task you will explore how to check code for vulnerabilities and code quality and how to automate fixing issues.

## Success Criteria

- You have detected vulnerabilities in the solution
- You have scanned the solution for code quality
- You have enabled Copilot to automatically review your Pull Reqests
- You have accepted changes proposed by Copilot

## Learning Resources

## Key Tasks

### 01: Enable code Code Quality features

GitHub provides built-in code quality tools to help maintain high standards across your codebase. If you enable code quality you will see the results of scans making recommendations for changes, and Copilot will recommend improvements for you to accept and commit into the repository.

1. Navigate to your repository **Settings** → **Security** → **Code quality**
   ![Enable Code Quality](../../media/0403_code_quality_enable.png)

2. Once open it will spend sometime setting up and then will show default setting
   ![Configure Code Quality](../../media/0403_code_quality_configuration.png)

### 02: Add vulnerable packages to the solution

To illustrate how GitHub can help protect developers from introducing security issues, you will add a few vulnerable packages to the solution and commit the changes.

1. Go to the solution in Visual Studio Code.

2. Open the `ZavaStorefront.csproj` file. Add the following packages to the file and save the changes:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="System.Text.Encodings.Web" Version="4.5.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Data.SqlClient" Version="2.1.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

3. From Terminal, issue the commands to add your changes and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'adding vulnerable packages'
git push
```

### 03: Create a Pull Request with Copilot review

Go to your repository at GitHub online and select the Code tab.
Create a Pull Request for your previous commit.

The Pull Request will require a reviewer based on the configuration settings applied to the organization. In addition, security and code quality scans will be completed.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to see detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. Navigate to your forked repository at GitHub online and select the Code tab.

2. From this tab, select Compare & pull request

![Start a Pull Request](../../media/0402_create_pr.png)

3. Create the Pull Request
You can generate the description for the Pull Request by selecting the Copilot icon and generating a summary for the committed work.
Once you have the title and description in place, select Create pull request.

![Create a Pull Request](../../media/0402_create_pr_2.png)

4. Wait for the Pull Request to be ready to merge
The Pull Request shows as pending 1 reviewer (in addition to the Copilot reviewer automatically added to the Pull Request). In addition, security and code quality scans must complete.

![Pull Request pending merge](../../media/0402_pending_merge.png)

</details>

> **NOTE** You can see that Copilot is automatically assigned as a reviewer based on the configurations completed in Task 01 of this Exercise.

### 04: Review Copilot review recommendations

The Copilot reviewer will scan code for vulnerabilities and offer suggested updates if there are any available. If you agree with the recommendation, you can accept the commit. Do this for one of the three issues.

You can also resolve the conversation without accepting the commit suggestion. Do this for the other two issues.

![Resolving a Copilot recommendation](../../media/0402_copilot_recs_resolve.png)

 Conversations must be resolved before the Pull Request can be completed, based on the organization configurations set up earlier. Consider resolving

 Eventually all scans will be completed and the Pull Request will be ready to be completed.

### 05: Review Dependabot alerts

1. View alerts
Navigate to the Security tab for the repository. Select the Dependabot menu under Vulnerability alerts.

The two Copilot recommendations for which you did not accept the suggestions will be listed in the Dependabot alerts list.

![Dependabot alerts](../../media/0402_dependabot_alerts.png)

You can choose to dismiss the alerts if you do not plan to fix them, otherwise you should resolve by removing the vulnerability from the code.

![Dismissing Dependabot alerts](../../media/0402_dependabot_alerts_2.png)

2. Accept Copilot updates for vulnerabilities
If you accepted any suggestions from Copilot review, you will need to pull the changes from the remote repository to your local.

From Visual Studio Code, open the Terminal window and enter commands to get latest and merge.

```bash
git pull
git commit -m 'merging vulnerability fixes'
git push
```
You'll notice that the command line also recognizes the vulnerabilities that are in the repository.

```bash
remote: GitHub found 2 vulnerabilities on zava-ai-lab/zava-ai-devops-copilot's default branch (1 high, 1 moderate). To find out more, visit:
remote:      https://github.com/zava-ai-lab/zava-ai-devops-copilot/security/dependabot
```
This will go away once the repository no longer has the vulnerability.

3. Fix Dependabot alerts by removing vulnerable code

From Visual Studio Code, open the `ZavaStorefront.csproj` file and remove the vulnerabilities previously added to the file. Commit this change.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'removing vulnerable packages'
git push
```
Go to your repository on GitHub online and create a new Pull Request for this update. Complete the pull request.

4. View that Dependabot alerts are gone

If you navigate to the Security tab and select the Dependabot menu under Vulnerability alerts, you'll see that the alerts have been automatically closed once the scan determined the vulnerable code was removed.

### 06: Review Code quality findings

Navigate to the Security tab for the repository. Select the Code quality -> AI findings menu under Vulnerability alerts.

You will see findings from the `ZavaStorefront.csproj` file. If you select the finding you'll see a recommendation to update from .NET 6 to .NET 8.

![Code quality findings](../../media/0402_codeq_findings.png)

### 07: Review secret scanning alerts

Navigate to the Security tab for the repository. Select the Secret scanning menu under Vulnerability alerts. You can choose from Default or Generic alerts.

Note that it will show the previous passwords and secrets that were introduced into the solution files earlier.

![Default secret scanning alerts](../../media/0402_secret_alerts_default.png)

![Generic secret scanning alerts](../../media/0402_secret_alert_generic.png)

These alerts will clear when the scanner runs and no longer detects the secrets present in the solution.

## Summary

You've completed this task. You have detected vulnerabilities in the solution, scanned the solution for code quality, enabled Copilot to automatically review your Pull Requests, and accepted changes proposed by Copilot.
