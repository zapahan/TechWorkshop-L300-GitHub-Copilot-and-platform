# Task 03 - Use GitHub Copilot to create a new feature

## Description

In this task you will use Copilot to add a new chat feature to our application.

## Success Criteria

- The application has a new Chat page that is connected to an existing Azure AI Foundry model

## Learning Resources

## Key Tasks

### 01: Create an Issue to track the feature

From Visual Studio Code, launch Copilot Chat:

![Opening Copilot Chat from VS Code](../../media/0501_vsc_openchat.png)

### 02: Set the Copilot Chat context

Set the context to the /src and /infra directories. You can click the attachment icon in the chat window and select from the dropdown list Files & Folders, then `src`. Do that again for `infra`

### 03: Create a GitHub issue with Copilot in Chat

In the chat window type `/create-issue ` followed by your prompt text. In this case you want to prompt indicating you want to add a new feature, for example:

```text
    /create-issue Add a new feature:
    - Add a simple chat functionality as a separate page that will send a text to an Azure Ai Foundry endpoint and will add the result to an existing text area.
    - Configure this feature to use the Phi4 endpoint that is already deployed
```

This will trigger actions that will look something like this:

![Create Issue](../../media/0503_code_copilot_issue_creation.png)

Once the Copilot is done you will see a response similar to this:

![Issue Created](../../media/0503_code_copilot_issue_created.png)

### 04: Create the feature with Copilot in Chat

1. From the chat window create a prompt to implement the issue, for example:

```text
@workspace implement issue #<your_issue_number>
```
> **NOTE** You can also prompt immediately after you create the issue with a prompt similar to this: `@workspace implement this issue`.

2. Copilot will start analyzing the solution and propose changes that are necessary to implement the feature, for example:

![Proposed Changes](../../media/0503_code_copilot_implement_issue.png)

3. Once you have reviewed the proposed changes, you can instruct Copilot to accept the changes using a prompt similar to this:

```text
Execute the proposed changes
```

4. Copilot will begin updating the solution and ask for your approval for each change:

![Copilot allow changes](../../media/0503_code_copilot_allow.png)

5. After all the changes are approved, you will see a response similar to this:

![Report](../../media/0503_code_copilot_result.png)

6. If you agree with the changes, select Keep. This will save the updated files locally for you.

![Keep](../../media/0503_code_copilot_files.png)

### 05: Compile and run the updated solution

Build the solution to make sure that everything works.

In order to run the application you will have to configure it to use your previously deployed Phi-4 model. One of the files generated by Copilot during the implementation step contains the setup instructions:

![Setup](../../media/0503_code_copilot_setup.png)

The instructions will look something similar to this:

![Setup instructions](../../media/0503_code_copilot_setup_instructions.png)

To configure the application you can either update those files to include your AI Foundry deployment configuration, you can define those as dotnet users-secrets, or as environment variables.

### 06: Commit the changes

If the solution is working as expected, you can commit the code to your current branch.

## Summary

You've completed this task. The application has a new Chat page that is connected to an existing Azure AI Foundry model.
