## Key Tasks

### 01: Update to .NET LTS using Copilot

From Visual Studio Code, select the Copilot icon to open Copilot Chat. Make sure you have the number for the issue you created in the previous task.

From the chat window create a prompt to implement the issue, for example:

```text
@workspace implement issue #<your_issue_number>
```

> **NOTE** You can also prompt immediately after you create the issue with a prompt similar to this: `@workspace implement this issue`.

Copilot wil start analyzing the solution and propose changes that are necessary to update the solution code to .NET LTS.

Once you have reviewed, you can instruct Copilot to accept the proposed changes using a prompt similar to this:

```text
Execute the proposed changes
```

Copilot will begin the update and ask your permission for each change:
