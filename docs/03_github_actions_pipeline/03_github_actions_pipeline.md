# Exercise 03: Build and Deploy a GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

## Scenario

This training will have you implement a customer proof of concept using DevOps and AI-driven development practices. The customer in this scenario is Zava, a retail chain that specializes in "do-it-yourself" solutions for home improvement projects. Zava has a simple storefront prototype and would like to establish best practices for DevOps setup and AI-assisted development and delivery. In this lab, you will configure GitHub Enterprise with security best practices, set up Visual Studio Code, GitHub Copilot, and Azure MCP Server to streamline DevOps planning and delivery, and extend the solution using Azure AI Foundry to generate and enhance application code.

In this exercise, you will create a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (workflow) to build and containerize the Zava application and then deploy it to your previously created Azure infrastructure.

## Objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll be able to:

* Create a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (workflow)
* Test the workflow as part of the Pull Request process
* Monitor and review the results of the workflow
* Troubleshoot issues with the workflow

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
